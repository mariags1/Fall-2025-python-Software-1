race() function:
1. Create 10 cars with registration numbers "ABC-1" - "ABC-10"
2. Each car's maximum speed is a random value between 100-200 km/h
3. Race the cars: each hour change each car's speed randomly by -10 to +15 km/h and drive for one hour
4. Stop when any car has travelled at least 10,000 km
5. Return a list of cars sorted by travelled distance (highest distance first)
